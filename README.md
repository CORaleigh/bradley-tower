This is the live, operational dashboard for the mayor of Los Angeles, which any city is welcome to use and customize. It has been built to be decidely simple to deploy and maintain; it is free and open source, can be hosted freely on GitHub, and is powered by Google Docs (another free solution). 

The core technology is TableTop.js, Bootstrap, Sheetsee.js, and Jekyll -- all client side software, which won't require a server or must work to get going. 

More documentation will be coming soon. 

Please reach out to @abhinemani if you're interested in helping out or redeploying it.
